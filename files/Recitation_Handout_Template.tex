\tbf{Grading for MA194:}
To receive a passing grade in MA194, you must receive a D or better in MA114, and have no more than two unexcused absences.

\tbf{Participation Grade for MA114:}
Reciation participation counts for $3.33\%$ of your overall grade in MA114, whether or not you are enrolled in MA194. At the end of each class (unless there is a quiz), you will turn in written work \textbf{with your name on it} for a selected problem from that day's worksheet. This will be used to keep track of your attendance. You are allowed (and encouraged) to work with others, and multiple people may turn in the same sheet of work as long as their names are clearly indicated at the top (honor system: do not add your name if you did not contribute). Each day's turned-in work will be worth four points. You will need \textbf{80 points} for a perfect participation grade. \par
It is expected that you attend all recitations unless prevented from doing so by some university approved reason (illness, death of a family member, traveling with university organization, religious holidays, etc.) See \url{https://www.uky.edu/ombud/excused-absences} for more information. For your absence to be excused, it is expected that you provide proof of the reason for your absence (before the absence if possible, as soon as possible after if the absence is unexpected).

\tbf{Quizzes:}
Quizzes will be given on the dates specified in the official course calendar. You will have approximately 15-20 minutes at the end of class to work on them. Once you are done with a quiz, you may turn it in at the front of the room and leave. Calculators will not be allowed for quizzes. \par If you require disability accommodations for quizzes please arrange to discuss this with me so we can be sure you have what you need.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tbf{Classroom Policies:}
You may use electronic devices such as laptops or tablets to access the worksheets and homework during class. I reserve the right to mark any student absent that does not participate in recitation or arrives more than 15 minutes late.
