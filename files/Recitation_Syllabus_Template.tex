\tbf{Instructor:} Michael Morrow\\
\tbf{Email:} michael.morrow@uky.edu\\
\tbf{Office:} Patterson Office Tower 722\\
\tbf{Office Hours:} Tu: 2:00pm-3:00pm (Mathskeller), Tu/Th: 10:00am-11:00am (POT 722)\\


This recitation syllabus is only for the \emph{recitation portion} of MA114. For matters relating to the course as a whole, or other policies not mentioned here, please consult the \href{http://www.ms.uky.edu/~ma114/f.22/}{main course syllabus}.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tbf{Purpose of Recitation:}\\
Provide students with a structured chance to collaboratively work on problems. The idea is that students work in groups and help one another, with the instructor providing hints and guidance only when necessary. We will have problem sheets and weekly quizzes to reinforce the information learned in lecture.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tbf{Email Policy:} \\
Email is the best way to contact me outside of class. Emails will usually be answered within 24 hours on weekdays and 48 hours on weekends. This applies to WebWork emails as well, so keep this in mind as you work on homework.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tbf{Attendance and Participation:}\\
Each recitation meeting, you will put your initials on a sign-in sheet that gets passed around the classroom 15 minutes after class begins (if you show up after 15 minutes, you will not be allowed to sign in unless you have a reasonable excuse). If you are enrolled in MA194 and have more than two unexcused absences from MA114, you will fail MA194. For more information regarding MA194, please see the \href{http://www.ms.uky.edu/~ma114/f.22/}{main syllabus for the course}. At the end of each class (unless there is a quiz), you will turn in written work \textbf{with your name on it} for a \textit{selected problem from that day's worksheet}. You are allowed (and encouraged) to work with others, and multiple people may turn in the same sheet of work as long as their names are clearly indicated at the top (honor system: do not add your name if you did not contribute). Your participation grade will be determined by your attendance and turned-in work. A perfect participation grade would look like no unexcused absences, and clear effort shown on each piece of turned-in work.\par
It is expected that you attend all recitations unless prevented from doing so by some university approved reason (illness, death of a family member, traveling with university organization, religious holidays, etc.) See \url{https://www.uky.edu/ombud/excused-absences} for more information. For your absence to be excused, it is expected that you provide proof of the reason for your absence (before the absence if possible, as soon as possible after if the absence is unexpected).

\tbf{Quizzes:}\\
Quizzes will be given on the dates specified in the \href{http://www.ms.uky.edu/~ma114/f.22/#calendar}{course calendar}. You will have approximately 15-20 minutes at the end of class to work on them. Once you are done with a quiz, you may turn it in at the front of the room and leave. Calculators will not be allowed for quizzes. The quiz grades contribute to your overall course grade as described in the grading section of the \href{http://www.ms.uky.edu/~ma114/f.22}{main course syllabus}.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tbf{Classroom Policies:}\\
All students are expected to behave in a manner conducive to an atmosphere of learning. This includes (but is not limited to) being courteous and respectful to other students and the instructor, being an active participant in class activities, arriving to class on time, and refraining from any behavior that may distract or disturb other students. \par You may use electronic devices such as laptops or tablets to access the worksheets and homework during class. I reserve the right to mark any student absent that does not participate in recitation or arrives more than 15 minutes late.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tbf{Academic Integrity:}\\
While you are allowed to work with other students and receive help from tutoring resources on homework assignments, the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding of the material. You may not copy another student's work and present it as your own. If you are turning in work as a group, it is expected that everyone whose name is on the sheet contributed to the work. Furthermore, no outside resources (classmates, notes, electronic devices, etc.) may be used on quizzes or exams. Please see \url{https://www.uky.edu/ombud/academic-integrity} for more information.   


\vspace{0.5cm}

\tbf{Accommodations:}\\
Students with documented physical, learning, or temporary disabilities may receive assistance and support from the Disability Resource Center. For more information, see \url{http://www.uky.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter/}. Students should provide the instructor with a copy of their accommodation letter as soon as possible. This may be in the form of an emailed PDF copy. Letters must be received \tbf{at least one week} prior to the requested accommodation. 

\vspace{0.5cm}


\tbf{Recording in the Classroom:}\\
Video and audio recordings are not permitted during the class unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. If permission is granted, recording of other students is prohibited. Any distribution of recordings is also probhibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the professor. All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and powerpoint lectures are the intellectual property of the instructors and cannot be reproduced, sold, or used for any purpose other than educational work in this class without prior permission from the professor.

\tbf{Changes to Syllabus:} I reserve the right to change or amend this syllabus at any time for any reason. In this event, proper notice will be given in class.

\tbf{Tips for Success:} 
\noindent\begin{itemize} 
\item ASK QUESTIONS. Questions are greatly encouraged in this class. However, often times students find themselves in a situation in which they are not sure what they are confused about or how to articulate a question. In these cases, I strongly encourage asking one or more of the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can you explain that again?
\item Can you explain that in a different way?
\item Can you pause for a moment? I need to catch up.
\end{itemize}
\item OFFICE HOURS. Office hours are specifically set up for you to come ask questions and get any additional help that you need. You do not need to make an appointment to come to office hours. These are for YOU. Please take advantage of them. If you cannot make it to office hours, do not hesitate to schedule an appointment with me.
\item FAIL OUT LOUD. Yes, you read that right. Do not be afraid to make a mistake, especially in front of me or your peers. Take a chance when you are unsure. You may turn out to be right, and if you're wrong, you will never forget the correct answer. Plus, you will remind your peers that no one is perfect all the time, which will in turn give them the courage to take a chance as well.
\end{itemize}
