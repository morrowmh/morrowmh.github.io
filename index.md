## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/files/profile.png">

I'm a fifth-year Mathematics graduate student at the [University of Kentucky](https://math.as.uky.edu/) working under the supervision of [Uwe Nagel](http://www.ms.uky.edu/~uwenagel/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Central Washington University in 2019 and my M.S. in Mathematics from the University of Kentucky in 2021.

## Research

My research interests include computational and combinatorial commutative algebra, and asymptotic algebra. My recent work involves the computation of Gröbner bases, syzygies and free resolutions in the setting of OI-modules over Noetherian polynomial OI-algebras. To facilitate this computation, I have written the Macaulay2 package "OIGroebnerBases.m2" which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/morrowmh/OIGroebnerBases).

### Papers
1. Computing Gröbner Bases and Free Resolutions of OI-Modules, with U. Nagel, submitted. Available at [arXiv:2303.06725](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06725).
