## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/files/profile.png">

Hello! I'm a fourth-year Mathematics graduate student at the [University of Kentucky](https://math.as.uky.edu/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Central Washington University in 2019 and my M.S. in Mathematics from the University of Kentucky in 2021. My hobbies include playing the guitar, cycling, fishing, camping, chess, beer brewing, cooking and coding.

## Research Interests

I am focused on Computational Commutative Algebra under the supervision of [Dr. Uwe Nagel](http://www.ms.uky.edu/~uwenagel/). Right now, I'm interested in the computation of Gr√∂bner bases, syzygies and free resolutions in the setting of OI-modules over Noetherian polynomial OI-algebras. For an introduction to the topic, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09247). To facilitate this computation, I have written the Macaulay2 package "OIGroebnerBases.m2" which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/morrowmh/OIGroebnerBases).

## Teaching

This Fall (2022) I will be a recitation leader for Calc II. More information to come.
