## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/files/profile.png">

I'm a fifth-year Mathematics graduate student at the [University of Kentucky](https://math.as.uky.edu/) working under the supervision of [Uwe Nagel](http://www.ms.uky.edu/~uwenagel/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Central Washington University in 2019 and my M.S. in Mathematics from the University of Kentucky in 2021.

## Research

My research interests include computational and combinatorial commutative algebra, and asymptotic algebra. My recent work involves the computation of Gröbner bases and syzygies in the setting of OI-modules over Noetherian polynomial OI-algebras. To facilitate this computation, I have written the Macaulay2 package "OIGroebnerBases.m2" which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/morrowmh/OIGroebnerBases).

### Papers
